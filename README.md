# Rust Practice Projects

These are some simple rust projects I'm building alongside reading "The Book" ([The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)], kept here for personal reference.

## Nix Notes
Make sure to run `nix-shell` in the base directory to get access to the basic rust environment
