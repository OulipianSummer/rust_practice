# Guessing Game

A project from the Rust docs that has a user guess randomly generated number between 1 and 100. Incorrect guesses will be re-prompted with a hint that the guess was either too hight or too low. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number. Invalid gusses will be rejected and reprompted.
